#doc (Page) "Formalising Mathematics in Lean - Utrecht Summerschool 2025" =>

An interactive theorem prover is a computer program to assist with the development of
mathematical proofs. By checking and automating proof steps, the machine aides the user in
creating proofs in a formal language understandable to the program.

Formalizing mathematics is the process of typing mathematical proofs into the interface of an
interactive theorem prover. In the past years, more and more mathematics, from undergraduate level
to the frontiers of modern research have been formalized in a variety of proof assistants.

While there are many interactive theorem provers, this course focuses on
Lean and its mathematical
library [mathlib][mathlib],
which already contains a substantial number of proofs of mathematical theorems and
infrastructure for proof automation.

# Target audience

The course is targeted to students familiar with rigorous mathematical proofs
(e.g. careful proofs by induction) that have an interest in theorem proving in Lean.

Students in science (mathematics, computer science, physics, etc) that are coursing the second
half of their bachelor, or are doing a MSc or a PhD will be well prepared for this course.
